@def title = "Part I The Senses"

## Part III - The Senses
This parts introduces key concepts of signal conditioning and filtering. Then reviews the different charactersitics that define sensor performance. 

Different types and classification of sensors will be given, and further discussion will be given for motion sensors. 

<!-- TODO: ADD diagram of system response with fancy animation  -->
