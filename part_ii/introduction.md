## Part II - The Cells
This part reviews basic concepts of passive circuit components and circuit analysis then treats in more detail switching semiconductors as they are an essential component in interfacing circuits with actuators. 

Operational amplifiers are also covered as they are a key component in signal conditioning. 

Passive components, semiconductors and op-amps are the main electrical and electronic building blocks of any mechatronic systems.
