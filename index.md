# ME 319 Mechatronics

<!-- \tableofcontents -->

This is a junior level course in the subject of mechatronics. The course introduces mechanical engineering students to concepts in computer engineering, electrical engineering, practical control theory and computing. 


Course syllabus can be found here: 
[Spring 2021 Distant Learning](assets/syllabus/ME319_Syllabus_DL_Spring2021.pdf)

The course is taught remotely during Spring 2021 through KU MS Teams and course material is hosted on [moodle.ku.edu.kw](https://moodle.ku.edu.kw)

Class Q&A is hosted on Piazza for class members.

# Prerequisites
The course assumes working knowledge of a programming language (usually MATLAB), and requires students to gain working knowledge in Embedded C/C++ programming, for which a mini-course is provided in conjunction with this course.
